--- In the intertube ---

"AS64241 is a small-scale autonomous system based out of Seattle. It's run by
Wobscale Technologies. Mainly, it's part of our colocation setup at the Seattle
Internet Exchange."

Jason turns down a hallway, leading you down a 1GiB wide tube, past flashing
link lights with labels like [doof &amp; knuckles](https://doof.net/).

"I see you've noticed our peering sessions. This is the heart of AS64241...
After all, an autonomous system can't very well exist in a vacuum. We have an
[open peering policy][peering] at SIX so we can create as large of a series of
tubes as possible."

At the end of the tube, it splits in two directions.

"To the right we have our colocation offerings, and to the left we have
something that's definitely not an ISP. Don't ask. I can also point you to our
Wobscale offices where we offer other services."

[Choose][colocation] -- Colocation sounds pretty rad, tell me more.

Don't Choose -- ISP?

[Choose][peering] -- I, too, am one of the roughly 300 SIX members and want to cross our tubes.

[Choose][wobscale-1b] -- Tell me more about this scaled wob. Is it a kind of lizard?
