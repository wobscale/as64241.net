--- Colocation pt. 2 ---

"Currently, our colocation setup is informal, at best.
We'll want to chat first to make sure what you're doing is reasonable.

We charge $80/mo for a 1U server, which includes a reasonable amount of power and internet, plus a chunk of ipv4 addresses (and as many ipv6 addresses as you can eat).

We're happy to help get stuff racked up, help with PXE or IPMI issues, and act as occasional remote hands.
... That all being said, if you're interested, you should [contact][contact]
[Wobscale Technologies][wobscale], preferably over IRC or email.

Note as well that we're still figuring some things out, so we may end up being
a co-op with you as a member, for example. You're not becoming a customer by
colocating with us, you're asking to be a part of the Wob to some degree.
