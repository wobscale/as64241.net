--- In the intertube ---

Jason opens the door wider and invites you in. You accompany him down a 1GiB wide tube.

BGP sessions line the walls, though the link lights show only modest traffic usage.

You pass one designated [doof &amp; knuckles](https://doof.net/), another marked as Microsoft, and many more.

"I see you've noticed our peering sessions~~(OwO)~~. This is the heart of AS64241...
After all, an autonomous system can't very well exist in a vacuum. We have an
[open peering policy][peering] at SIX so we can create as large of a series of
tubes as possible."

At the end of the tube, it splits in two directions.

"To the right we have our colocation offerings, and to the left we have
something that's definitely not an ISP. Don't ask. I can also point you to our
Wobscale offices where we offer other services."

[Choose][colocation] -- Colocation sounds pretty rad, tell me more.

Don't Choose -- ISP?

[Choose][peering] -- I, too, am one of the roughly 300 SIX members and want to cross our tubes, or am interested in contact information related to such an operation.

[Choose][wobscale-1b] -- Tell me more about this scaled wob. Is it a kind of lizard?
