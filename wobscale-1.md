--- Scaling the Wobs ---

Jason invites you in. "Wobscale Technologies is a Seattle-based Technology Collective", he quotes from the [wobscale.website](https://wobscale.website) website. "We've operated since 2016." He points to a small row of conspicuously posted business license tax certificates in the entranceway.

"If you want to learn more about Wobscale Technologies itself, you should visit that page instead," he says, pointing at the above link. "This page is about AS64241, which is just one of Wobscale's projects".

[Choose](https://wobscale.website) -- Can you zap me over to that Wobscale Website you're talking about?

[Choose][about-1b] -- I guess I'm here, so I might as well hear about AS64241.

[Choose][end] -- I think I've heard enough, thanks though!
