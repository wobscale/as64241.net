"Wobscale Technologies, in addition to running AS64241, also provides Server Colocation in Seattle, WA. Let me forward you to our colocation specialist" he says as he attaches you to a letter and sends you through the æther to iliana's office.

we peer with at SIX... and we have a bunch of other services members are
welcome to use!"
