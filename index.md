--- Outside the door ---

You read the large neon sign hanging over the door of the Seattle-based 
[peering establishment][sigil-peering] you've come across.

The neon 'N's light flickers wearily and gives up.

You knock, and a ~~young lad~~ "security" "professional" opens the door and flashes a grin.

"Wobscale Technologies, I'm Jason, how may I take your order?"

[Choose][about-1] -- What can you tell me about this AS64241 operation?

[Choose][wobscale-1] -- What is Wobscale Technologies?

[Choose][zork] -- North, east, open window, enter, up.

[Choose][end] -- [Close the door and leave]

[Email](mailto:admin@wobscale.website) -- I don't have time for this, give me a *real* human!
